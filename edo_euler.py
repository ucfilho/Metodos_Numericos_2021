def euler( f, x0, t ):
    """Euler's method to solve x' = f(x,t) with x(t[0]) = x0.

    USAGE:
        x = euler(f, x0, t)

    INPUT:
        f     - function of x and t equal to dx/dt.  x may be multivalued,
                in which case it should a list or a NumPy array.  In this
                case f must return a NumPy array with the same dimension
                as x.
        x0    - the initial condition(s).  Specifies the value of x when
                t = t[0].  Can be either a scalar or a list or NumPy array
                if a system of equations is being solved.
        t     - list or NumPy array of t values to compute solution at.
                t[0] is the the initial condition point, and the difference
                h=t[i+1]-t[i] determines the step size h.

    OUTPUT:
        x     - NumPy array containing solution values corresponding to each
                entry in t array.  If a system is being solved, x will be
                an array of arrays.
